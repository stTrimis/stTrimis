# 🌿 About Me — Stelios

Hi, I'm **Stelios** — someone who enjoys learning, building things, and exploring the world at his own pace.

Right now, I'm living and working in **Iceland** 🇮🇸 as a waiter.  
Not because “I have to,” but because I chose to step away from the noise for a while and enjoy the **present moment** a bit more.  
Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is hit pause, change your scenery, and give yourself the space to breathe.

## ✨ What I do when I'm not serving coffee

- I tinker with code, UI, and small projects that brighten my day  
- I learn new tools and technologies because curiosity never stops  
- I slowly build a portfolio that truly represents me  
- I think about my next step — but without pressure, because the present already has enough beauty

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Java / Swing** for desktop applications   
- **UI/UX design** with a focus on logic and clean aesthetics  
- **Automation & workflow organization**  
- **GitHub** to keep everything tidy

## 🌍 Why Iceland?

Because sometimes you need to change countries to change perspective.  
Because the calm, the nature, and the fresh air help you find your rhythm again.  
And because there's no need to rush — the next step comes when you're ready.
